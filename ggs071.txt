                                                         SUMMARY
                                                         The divergent boundary between the Somalia and Nubia plates is a complex tectonic domain
                                                         where extensional processes are localized along narrow rift structures, isolating small blocks
                                                         imbedded within the East African Rift. One of these tectonic units is the Victoria Block,
                                                         which is the subject of this study. Here we process space-geodetic data for 37 permanent
                                                         GNSS stations distributed along Nubia, Somalia and Victoria to (1) compute the motion of
                                                         the three tectonic units in the ITRF2008 reference frame and (2) deduce the relative motion
                                                         of Victoria with respect to its neighbouring plates. The Nubia Plate motion is computed from
                                                         a set of 25 stations, the Somalia Plate motion from a set of 7 stations and the Victoria motion
                                                         from a set of 5 stations. Although the number and distribution of the used stations is still not
                                                         optimal, the good adjustment between observed and predicted motions confirms that Victoria
                                                         acts as a rigid tectonic block. The instantaneous relative Euler poles for the Nubia­Victoria
                                                         and Somalia­Victoria pairs are now evaluated as 10.66o N, 32.98Eo , 0.120o Myr­1 and 8.02o S,
                                                         32.29o E, 0.159o Myr­1 , respectively. The computation of the relative interplate velocities along
                                                         Victoria's boundary is straightforward in most situations because the western and northeastern
                                                         boundary segments correspond to well-developed rift basins, where extension is mostly normal
                                                         to rift basin flanks and seismicity concentrates along narrow structures. This is particularly
                                                         evident on the Western Branch between Victoria and Nubia. The southeastern limit of the
                                                         Victoria Block is poorly defined, and geodetic data indicate that differential motion between
                                                         Somalia and Victoria may be accommodated by a complex boundary area, which roughly
                                                         encompasses the Masai Terrain. Geodetic observations of the Victoria­Somalia boundary
                                                         along the Eastern Branch, particularly in the Manyara Rift, reveal highly oblique horizontal
                                                         extension. In this region seismicity is sparse which suggests that strain is accommodated by
